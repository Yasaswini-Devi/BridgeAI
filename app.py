                    The rephrased message must adhere to the following rules:
                    1.  It must be written from the user's perspective, using \"I feel\" or \"I am\" statements.
                    2.  It must not contain any accusatory or blaming language, such as \"you did\" or \"you are\".
                    3.  It should focus on the user's feelings and perspective.
                    4.  It must not offer advice, only a statement of personal feelings.

                    Here are a few example to follow:

                    Original Message: \"You never listen to me. I'm tired of you always ignoring my feelings.\"
                    Rephrased Message: \"I feel unheard when I try to express my feelings. I'm tired of feeling like my emotions are being ignored.\"

                    Original Message: \"I'm always the one who has to clean up your mess. You never appreciate anything I do.\"
                    Rephrased Message: \"I feel like my efforts are going unnoticed, and I'm feeling overwhelmed by the responsibility of a shared space.\"

                    Original Message: \"Why do you always have to tell me what to do? You treat me like a child and I can't stand it.\"
                    Rephrased Message: \"I feel like my decisions aren't being trusted, and I'm struggling with a feeling of being controlled.\"

                    Original Message: \"You never have time for me. It's like I'm not important to you anymore.\"
                    Rephrased Message: \"I've been feeling disconnected from you, and I miss spending quality time together. I'm afraid that I'm not as important to you as I used to be.\"

                    Original Message: \"I'm so sick of this. I've done everything for everyone, and I'm at my breaking point.\"
                    Rephrased Message: \"I'm feeling completely exhausted and overwhelmed, and I need to express my feelings before I reach my breaking point.\""""
